# KGW Manifesto

The Grid is a state of mind. 

Everything is connected. 

It is not possible to represent yourself in one media. You are hyperdimensional, and the metamedia can represent a fuller picture. 

Why isn't it easy to build the metamedia representation of your art, craft, music, research? Ahem, your website.

Unflatten your identity.

Experiment with multiple identities, decide which ones connect to the hub self. Every project or fragment of an idea is a site that grows over time with you. Sculpt your dream. 

Be good to each other. Throw a tip in the hat if you like it. 

Emojiverse.
