description: "The guineafowl (; sometimes called \"Original Fowl\" or guineahen) are a family of birds in the Galliformes order, although some authorities (for example the American Ornithologists' Union) include the guineafowl as a subfamily, Numidinae, of the family Phasianidae. The guineafowl are native to Africa, but the helmeted guineafowl as wild birds have been introduced elsewhere."
