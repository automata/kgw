\> But depression is a subsidiary aspect of thanaticism. You are supposed to be depressed, and you are supposed to think that's your individual failing or problem. Your bright illusory fantasy-world is ripped away from you, and the thanatic reality is bared -- you are supposed to think its your fault. You have failed to believe. See a shrink. Take some drugs. Do some retail therapy.
