description: "Ben Lamm, CEO of Chaotic Moon, is understandably excited while talking about his company's innovation. Dubbed 'Tech Tats', the tattoo kit, now in the prototype stage, will collect and transmit data similar to the Jawbone or Apple Watch. The tattoo, which washes off, will send data to medical staff and can also have military applications."
