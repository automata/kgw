    description: 'After Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, decided to renovate their hilltop house in La Jolla, Calif. She and an assistant cleared out his office, donating most of his valuable illustrations and early drafts to the University of California, San Diego, and stashing some doodles and abandoned sketches in a box.'

description: "When we celebrated the 108th would-be birthday of Dr. Seuss earlier this month with his little-known, body-positive \"adult\" book of nudes, reader Jennifer Alluisi flagged a fascinating deeper dive into Geisel's more obscure creations - The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss (public library | IndieBound ), originally published in 1995, collects 65 of Geisel's whimsical paintings, sculptures, and rough sketches of weird and wonderful beings in otherworldly settings, created for his own pleasure and never exhibited in public."
